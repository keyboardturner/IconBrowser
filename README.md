# IconBrowser

This addon provides a replacement icon browser for the macro, bank, guild bank, and transmog frames with a search bar and quite a few preset filters in a dropdown menu.

Filters include Class, Culture, Weapon, Armor, Magic, Factions, Professions, Achievements, Housing, and Items.

Additionally, it includes API code for other addon devs to create their own via `LRPMediaIconBrowserAPI.CreateBrowser` (look in the bottom of IconBrowser.lua for usage)
